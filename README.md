# AI Min-Max algorithm
# The minimax function recursively evaluates all possible moves and assigns a score to each move. The computer selects the move with the highest score.

# After the computer makes its move, the game checks for a win or tie condition as before. If the game ends, a message is displayed. Otherwise, the current player is updated.

# Please note that the computer's moves are deterministic in this implementation, which means the computer will always make the optimal move. If you want to add more complexity or randomness to the computer's moves, you can modify the makeComputerMove function accordingly.
